OpenTelemetry can be used to trace a single user transaction end-to-end‚Äîfrom a React UI button click, through a Node.js Azure Function, across Azure Service Bus messages, and into Azure PostgreSQL database transactions. Here's how each component fits into the tracing pipeline:

üñ±Ô∏è React UI (Frontend)
You can instrument your React application using OpenTelemetry's web SDK:

Use @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-web and @opentelemetry/instrumentation-fetch to capture user interactions like button clicks and outgoing HTTP requests.

These traces can be propagated using W3C Trace Context headers, which are automatically added to fetch/XHR requests.

‚öôÔ∏è Node.js Azure Function App
Azure Functions support OpenTelemetry in preview mode:

You can enable OpenTelemetry in the host.json file by setting "telemetryMode": "OpenTelemetry".

Use the @azure/functions-opentelemetry-instrumentation package to automatically instrument your Node.js Azure Functions3.

This setup allows the function to receive and propagate trace context from the frontend.

üì© Azure Service Bus
Tracing across Service Bus requires manual context propagation:

Inject and extract trace context using OpenTelemetry APIs when sending and receiving messages.

Use @opentelemetry/instrumentation-azure-sdk or custom instrumentation to trace message publishing and consumption.

üóÑÔ∏è Azure PostgreSQL
Database tracing is possible with OpenTelemetry instrumentation:

Use @opentelemetry/instrumentation-pg for PostgreSQL to trace SQL queries.

Ensure the trace context is preserved from the function app to the database layer.

üß† End-to-End Correlation
To correlate the entire transaction:

Use consistent trace IDs across all services.

Export telemetry to a backend like Jaeger, Zipkin, or Azure Monitor via the OpenTelemetry Collector.

Visualize the full trace from UI to database, including latency and errors.
