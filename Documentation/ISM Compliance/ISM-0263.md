# ISM-0263 TLS traffic is inspected

TLS traffic communicated through gateways is decrypted and inspected.

## Gaps
The codebase and scripts show enforcement of HTTPS/TLS for all inbound connections (good for encryption in transit).
There is no technical evidence in this code base or infra scripts that TLS traffic is actually being decrypted and inspected at network gateways (as required by ISM-0263)—i.e., no SSL break-and-inspect demonstrated in code or IaC.

## Description
AWS Cloudfront is used as the gateway, it is configured to decrypt and inspect traffic at a high level and log every request.
Cloudfront then re-encrypts and forward the traffic to Azure App Gatweay which further inspects the traffic for application level threats, and record any warning into XXXX where security support staff are investigating warning.

## Evidence
The saolution architecture document was signted and contained the above section regarding the gateway, a screenshot of the architecture diagram is recorded in the evidence file.
Screenshots of the system configuration showing alignment with the architecture was recorded.
